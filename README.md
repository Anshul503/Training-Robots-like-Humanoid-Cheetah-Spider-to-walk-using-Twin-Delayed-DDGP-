# Training-Robots-like-Humanoid-Cheetah-Spider-to-walk-using-Twin-Delayed-DDGP-
This project is done on "Google Collab" with the help of Udemy Instructor and trained humanoid, Cheetah, spider " to walk using Deep Reinforcement Learning technique called "Twin Delayed DDGP (Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy)" which is latest topic(2017) and researchers are still working on it to get better and better result at the end.              This is the most difficult project I have done in the field of Machine Learning and to train this model, it took me almost 2-3 hrs.But at the end, the results are very satisfying!
